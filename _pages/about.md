I'm a second-year graduate student from [China Economics and Management Academy](http://cema.cufe.edu.cn/), [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://www.cufe.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor’s degree of Economics (minoring in Finance) in [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn), [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn). My research interest includes blockchain economics, machine learning, and industrial organization.

**Skills**: Python, Matlab, R, Stata

**Languages**: Chinese(native), English(TOEFL 105), Japanese(elementary)

**Hobbies**: In personal life, I like coding, reading, swimming, and listening to music. 

**Coding**: I am good at data analysis in Python and I have learned the basic framework of machine learning and made practices such as _Using hybrid model(e.g. SVM+AR) to predict daily PM2.5 of Chengdu_. With such passion in computer science, I had classes on Data analysis in Python, Database(SQL), Data structure in C++, Big data in Hadoop, Data mining, Data science in R, Data modeling in Matlab (and Principles of blockchain, of course), etc. Now I am immersed in learning knowledge of blockchain (especially on smart contracts and DeFi) and reading papers on Economic theory of blockchain applications.

**Reading: The more I buy, the more I read.** I enjoy collecting classic books in various fields and read them slowly but hard, such as literature, economics, history, computer science, psychology, philosophy and even music. Recently I am reading _The Theory of Interest_ by Fisher. If you like reading as well, do not hesitate to get in touch.

**Music**: Jazz helps me relax and the rhythm is floating while rock is vigorous or sometimes deep and blue(Post-Rock). I also like classic music but cannot fully get it due to the limited knowledge of music theory and the technique of playing instruments (I am learning by listening). R.I.P, Sakamoto Ryuichi.
