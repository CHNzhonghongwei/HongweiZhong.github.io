I’m a second-year graduate student from [China Economics and Management Academy](http://cema.cufe.edu.cn/), [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://www.cufe.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics (minoring in Finance) from [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/), [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/). My research interest includes blockchain economics, machine learning, and industrial organization.

**Skills**: Python, Matlab, R, Stata

**Languages**: Chinese(native), English(TOEFL 105), Japanese(elementary)

**Hobbies**: In my personal life, I like coding, reading, swimming, and listening to music.

**Coding**: I am good at data analysis in Python, and I have learned the basic framework of machine learning and made practices such as *Using a hybrid model(e.g., SVM+AR) to predict daily PM2.5 of Chengdu*. With such passion for computer science, I had classes on Data Analysis in Python, Database(SQL), Data Structure in C++, Big data in Hadoop, Data Mining, Data Science in R, Mathematical modeling in Matlab (and Principles of blockchain, of course), etc. Now I am immersed in learning knowledge of blockchain (especially on smart contracts and DeFi) and reading papers on the Economic theory of blockchain applications.

**Reading: The more I buy, the more I read.** I enjoy collecting classic books in various fields and reading them slowly but hard, such as literature, economics, history, computer science, psychology, philosophy, and even music. Recently I am reading *The Theory of Interest* by Fisher. If you like reading as well, do not hesitate to get in touch.

**Music**: Jazz helps me relax and the rhythm is floating while rock is vigorous or sometimes deep and blue(Post-Rock). I also like classic music but cannot fully get it due to my limited knowledge of music theory and the techniques of playing instruments (I am learning by listening). R.I.P., Sakamoto Ryuichi.
